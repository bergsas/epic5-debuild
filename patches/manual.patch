 .Sh PRACTICAL EXAMPLES
 Certainly any description of 
-.Nm epic 
+.Nm epic5 
 in this man page will be sorely inadequate because most of the confusion doesn't even start until after you get the client to connect to a server.  
 But if you really have problems getting the client to connect to a server, try some of these:
-.Bl -tag -width "epic"
-.It Nm epic
+.Bl -tag -width "epic5"
+.It Nm epic5
 Try this first.  
 This will assume all the defaults.  
-If the person who is maintaining epic at your site has done a halfway decent job, this will put you on a server that is somewhat local to you. 
-.It Nm "epic nickname irc.domain.com"
+If the person who is maintaining epic5 at your site has done a halfway decent job, this will put you on a server that is somewhat local to you. 
+.It Nm "epic5 nickname irc.domain.com"
 or something similar will attempt to connect to the irc server running on the host "irc.domain.com" (fill in a real irc server here) with the nickname of well, "nickname".  
 This is the most common way to specify an alternate server to use.
-.It Nm "epic nickname irc.domain.com:6664"
+.It Nm "epic5 nickname irc.domain.com:6664"
 Sometimes, some servers are really busy, and it can take them a long time to establish a connection with you on the default port (6667).  
 Most major servers on big public networks accept connections on many different ports, with the most common being most or all of the ports between 6660 and 6675.
 You can usually connect much faster if you use a port other than 6667, if the server you're connecting to supports an alternate port.
-.It Nm "epic nickname irc.efnet.net"
+.It Nm "epic5 nickname irc.efnet.net"
 If you're totally stumped and trying to get on efnet, try this.
